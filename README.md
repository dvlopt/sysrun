# Sysrun

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/dvlopt/sysrun.svg)](https://clojars.org/dvlopt/sysrun)

A set of system/JVM utility functions for clojure.

Do you want to execute a function when the JVM shutdowns ?

Look at memory usage ?

Precisely time what is going on ?

Then read the [API](https://dvlopt.github.io/doc/sysrun/).
