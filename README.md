# Sysrun

[![Clojars
Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/dvlopt/sysrun.svg)](https://clojars.org/dvlopt/sysrun)

Set of system and JVM related functions, the kind of utilities provided by the
System and Runtime classes but in decent clojure.

# Usage

Do you wish to execute a function when the JVM shutdowns ?
Look at memory usage ?
Precisely time what is going on ?

Then read the [API](https://dvlopt.github.io/doc/dvlopt/sysrun/index.html).
